# SudokuSolver
A sudoku solver I made using Python and pygame
This program uses an algorithm known as recursive backtracking, I strongly encourage you to look into it if you've not heard of it.
It's an actual practical use of recursion instead of the factorial bullshit they teach in universities. It's an elegant solution to
a (fairly) mind-intensive problem.

Also, the code is shit because I'm using Python after a long time (2 years maybe?) so yeah, sucks.
Actually been a while since I've used any dynamic language, so a lot of bad practices here...
